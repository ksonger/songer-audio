We've had the pleasure of spending time recently with Pat Hickman and Matt Kamna of Whammerdyne, enjoying some wonderful listening sessions with the Onimaru driver and Enso loudspeaker paired with a variety of Whammerdyne amplifiers, and... WOW! <p>We had no idea that our drivers or the Enso could possibly sound any better than we've already heard it, but the performance they delivered when mated with these amazing amplifiers is top-tier - simply staggering.</p><p>Our first listening session substituted the stock Beyma horns in Pat's magnificent Pure Audio Project Quintets with a pair of our Onimaru drivers.  Powered by the gorgeous Ultimate Truth amplifier, the result was truly something to behold.  Matched with eight Eminence 15\" drivers in the Quintets, the Onimaru reproduced music that was rich, room filling and utterly life-like and detailed in presentation.</p><p>Our second session was at Matt's place this time, pairing the Enso loudspeaker alternatingly with a Whammerdyne DGA-1, and a spectacular new prototype of Matt's recent creation.  Also along for the fun, Mr. Eddie Pletka of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.eurotubes.com/store/pc/home.asp'>Eurotubes</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.decibel-pdx.com/'>Decibel Sound and Drink</a>. The sound during this session was even better than the last, simply outrageous.  It was easily one of the finest listening experiences of my life, and a fun day that I won't soon forget.  The hours just seem to fly by when the music is so captivating, and we all regretted when the time came to pack things up and turn for home.</p><p>After hearing our speaker paired with the DGA-1, well... I had to have one of my own.  I just can't listen to them paired with anything less.</p>",
