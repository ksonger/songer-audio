# common-js/hooks

A repository for common React hooks

## Requires

React!

## Import it!

`@castiron/hooks/` is set up so that you can import hooks individually,
in little bite sized pieces.

```
// Cherry-pick methods for smaller bundles.

import useReduceMotion from "@castiron/hooks/useReduceMotion";
```
